Build an interactive UI to display a list of an organization's Github projects ranked by any meaningful metric you'd like, and allow the user to browse recent commits on that project. Organization name should be an input from the user.

# AngularApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0. The project uses Angular4 with bootstrap4. The reason these technologies were used are because:
  1. Bootstrap4 is the leading design framework for scaffolding front end pages. It provides plenty of predesigned components that helped me create a beautiful page quick. I have embedded bootstrap in this application using a CDN however the right way to embed it in an angular application would have been by using a bootstrap4 npm module and using angular-cli to attach it to the index.html during complilation.
  2. Angular4 is being currently used by many teams including mine as one of the best MVC frameworks. I like that it has plenty of community support and resources online to help me during the development process. It has a very clear modularized develpoment process and using typescript along with angular-cli makes the build process fast and easy. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
